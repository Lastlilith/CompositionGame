        The rules of the game: there will be three figures in front of you, two below and one above,
        two of them will be numbers. It is required that the sum of the numbers from the two lower
        figures is equal to the number in the upper figure. To do this, insert the missing number.
        \ n \ nExample: in the upper circle the number 7, in one from the lower ones there is a
        question mark, and in the other is number 4. It means, in place of the question mark should
        be the number 3 because 3 + 4 = 7
