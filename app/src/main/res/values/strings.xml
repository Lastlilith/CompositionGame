        <b>The rules of the game:</b> There will be three figures in front of you, two below and one above. Two of them will be numbers. It is required that the sum of the numbers from two lower figures is equal to the number in the upper figure. To do this, insert the missing number.

        \n\n\t<b>Example:</b> In the upper circle the number is 7. In one from the lower ones there is a question mark, and in another one is number 4. It means, in place of the question mark should be number 3, because
        <b>3 + 4 = 7</b>
